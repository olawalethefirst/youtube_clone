# [Youtube Clone](https://olawalethefirst-youtube-clone.netlify.app)
This is a React application that aims to replicate some of the key features of the popular YouTube platform. It provides users with the ability to surf, search for, and watch videos within a familiar and user-friendly interface.

Key Features:
1. Video Surfing: The application offers users the ability to browse and explore a wide range of videos through a classification of grouped videos. These groups include popular channels, sport videos, podcasts and more	. Users can navigate through these groups and discover new and interesting content.
2. Advanced Video Search: Users can search for specific videos using unique keywords. The application's search functionality allows users to enter keywords related to video titles, descriptions, or even channels, helping them find videos that align with their interests. Search results will display relevant videos based on the entered keywords.
3. Video Playback: allows users to watch videos seamlessly within the application. Users can click on a video thumbnail to open the video player, which provides controls for play/pause, volume adjustment, full-screen mode, and more. The video player ensures a smooth and immersive viewing experience for users.
4. Video Recommendations: Based on the currently playing video, the application provides video recommendations. These recommendations suggest similar videos or videos from related categories, helping users discover new content that aligns with their preferences.
5. User-Friendly Interface: offers a visually appealing and intuitive user interface that resembles the familiar layout of the original YouTube application.

The application is powered by the [rapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com) endpoint, [YoutubeV3](https://rapidapi.com/ytdlfree/api/youtube-v31?utm_source=youtube.com%2FJavaScriptMastery&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=DevRel). It uses [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for navigation and [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) component library for its user interface design.
